          <h3>Design & Development</h3>
          <p>Considering my skillset, I'm currently pursuing a degree in Multi-Platform Software Development at Fatec. I have a strong foundation in web technologies, including HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and jQuery, as well as experience with Git for version control. I'm actively learning TypeScript, demonstrating my commitment to continuous improvement. Additionally, I'm venturing into back-end development with APIs, Node.js, and Express.js, and I have a solid understanding of database management with SQL, MongoDB, and Mongoose. My familiarity with React.js hints at my readiness to create dynamic and responsive user interfaces.

            In parallel to my coursework, I'm gaining valuable practical experience through group projects at college. These projects involve not only software development but also the application of Scrum methodology and Git for effective project management. Furthermore, I'm expanding my skill set by using design tools like Figma and delving into various design concepts. This hands-on experience and exposure to collaborative development practices are preparing me to excel in real-world software development scenarios.</p>

          <h3>Love Gaming</h3>
          <p>One of my best skills is Gaming. I always learn fast how to be a good player at the most of the games that I play, and get better and better against the most of players.</p>
